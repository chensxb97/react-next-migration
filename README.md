## React-NextJS Migration
This projects explores the migration process of a basic React App to a NextJS App.
The migration will be performed using the [react-app-template](https://github.com/chensxb97/react-app-template) as our base React App.

### Procedure
We will follow the steps outlined in the [NextJS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/from-create-react-app#built-in-optimizations).

### Migration Plan

**Phase 1**: Initial Migration should create a fully functional application written in the NextJS framework. App should still be purely rendered on the client.

**Phase 2**: Slowly migrate some components to server components.
